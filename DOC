WEBALBUMCREATOR LIBRARY


INTRODUCTION

WebAlbumCreator is a UNIX-style library written in C++. Its main purpose is
to give an ability to create a web page with your photos. All you need is the
archive with photos in one of the popular formats (you can find the full list
of supported formats below). The library has been originally written by
Kirill Alekseev except the followings:
    - zlib
    - stb
    - libarchive


BUILDING

You will need GNU Make to build this library.

    make static //builds the static binary

There are some examples coming with the library (you can find them in the
'examples' folder).

    make //builds the examples


QUICK START

The library contains three main classes:
    1) Extractor
    2) ThumbnailsCreator
    3) WebPageGenerator

So the whole algorithm to create a web page with your photos is as simple as
using these three classes: you need to extract your photos with the Extractor,
create thumbnails with the ThumbnailsCreator and generate a web page with the
WebPageGenerator.

Just include the 'WebAlbumCreator.h' and link with the -l wac


EXTRACTOR

Extractor is a class with a main purpose to extract photos from your archive.

The following formats are accepted:
    * GNU tar format
    * Solaris 9 extended tar format (including ACLs)
    * Old V7 tar archives
    * POSIX ustar
    * POSIX pax interchange format
    * POSIX octet-oriented cpio
    * SVR4 ASCII cpio
    * POSIX octet-oriented cpio
    * Binary cpio (big-endian or little-endian)
    * ISO9660 CD-ROM images (with optional Rockridge or Joliet extensions)
    * ZIP archives (with uncompressed or "deflate" compressed entries)
    * GNU and BSD 'ar' archives
    * 'mtree' format
    * 7-Zip archives
    * Microsoft CAB format
    * LHA and LZH archives
    * RAR archives
    * XAR archives

Extractor has only one constructor and it takes no arguments:

    Extractor()

Extractor has the following public methods:

    void SetPathToUnpack(const char *)

    void SetPathToFile(const char *)

    const char *GetPathToUnpack() const

    const char *GetPathToFile() const

    void Extract()

After you have created the Extractor object you will need to set the path to the
archive with photos (required) and the path where to unpack (not required). If
you don't set the path where to unpack your archive it will be unpacked to the
directory where your executable is.


THUMBNAILS CREATOR

ThumbnailsCreator is a class with the main purpose to make thumbnails for your
photos

The following formats for photos are accepted:
    * JPEG baseline & progressive (12 bpc/arithmetic not supported, same as stock IJG lib)
    * PNG 1/2/4/8-bit-per-channel (16 bpc not supported)

    * TGA (not sure what subset, if a subset)
    * BMP non-1bpp, non-RLE
    * PSD (composited view only, no extra channels, 8/16 bit-per-channel)

    * GIF (*comp always reports as 4-channel)
    * HDR (radiance rgbE format)
    * PIC (Softimage PIC)
    * PNM (PPM and PGM binary only)

ThumbnailsCreator has only one constructor and it takes no arguments:

    ThumbnailsCreator()

ThumbnailsCreator has the following public methods:

    void SetPathToOriginals(const char *)

    void SetPathToThumbnails(const char *)

    const char *GetPathToOriginals() const

    const char *GetPathToThumbnails() const

    void CreateThumbnails() const;

After you have created the ThumbnailsCreator object you will need to set the
path to the original phots (required) and the path where to put thumbnails
(not required). If you don't set the path where to put the thumbnails it will
be put to the directory where your executable is.
